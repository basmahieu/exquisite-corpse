# Moving out

Had they known about the fire and what came after they never would have moved into their dream house.

They couldn’t understand creeks and groans of the wood, and so they couldn’t hear what their dreaming house was saying. The yard was scrubby and small but it was bigger than the bleak concrete slab they left behind in Detroit. There were 3 floors but some important structure missing... They couldn't access the higher floors because there were no stairs. The rooms were wonderfully decorated tough.

They wanted to live simply and wanted freedom. Nothing inspires them more than the smallest things they see here, from morning birdsong to the gentle rustle of the trees. They never get bored as there is always something to do, whether for pleasure or out of necessity. But they are more than happy, as this gives them more freedom.

Until the faithful day arrived, the day nobody imagines could happen to them. It started one simple night, a night where everyone goes to the spaces they can  call "their rooms" to get some sleep, ater another unispiring day in the back yard. The creaking of the house was more intense this night, it was not setteling in like other nights. The creaking became stronger and stronger, until the noise got everyone out of bed. Everyone was in bed, and the night was silent, no wind was blowing, but the creaking never stopped. Following the sound of the old house, they stopped at the lost piece of the stairs, the one leading to the third floor. There, the creaking became more audible, but soft. We couldnt make out what was being said, all but one word, one name that whispered into your head and would remain there, planted, for years to come. That name that changed their lives forever, "Scooby Doo".
