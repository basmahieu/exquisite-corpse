# Moving out

Had they known about the fire and what came after they never would have moved into their dream house.
They couldn’t understand creeks and groans of the wood, and so they couldn’t hear what their dreaming house was saying.
The yard was scrubby and small but it was bigger than the bleak concrete slab they left behind in Detroit.   

There were 3 floors but some important structure missing...   

They couldn't access the higher floors because there were no stairs. 
The rooms were wonderfully decorated tough.   


They wanted to _live simply and wanted freedom._ 
Nothing inspires them more than the smallest things they see here, from morning birdsong to the gentle rustle of the trees.
They never get bored as there is always something to do, whether for pleasure or out of necessity. But they are more than happy, as this gives them more freedom.
